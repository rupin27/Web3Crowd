Currently, the platform thirdweb is facing issue when it comes to deploying contracts to their dashboard, hence once the issue is resolved, I plan to launch the application for you use. In the meantime, I encourage you to contribute to the issue. [Link to the issue](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/issues/493)
